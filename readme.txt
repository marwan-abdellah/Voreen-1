====================================

About
-----
Voreen is an open source rapid application development framework for the interactive visualization
and analysis of multi-modal volumetric data sets. It provides GPU-based volume rendering and data 
analysis techniques and offers high flexibility when developing new analysis workflows in 
collaboration with domain experts. The Voreen framework consists of a multi-platform C++ library, 
which can be easily integrated into existing applications, and a Qt-based stand-alone application.
It is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. 
The Voreen project has been initiated and is maintained by the Visualization & Computer Graphics 
Research Group at the University of Münster as part of the central project Z1 of the collaborative 
research center SFB 656 MoBil.

For build instructions and further information, please refer to the project website.
